    <h1>!ABOUT US!</a></h1>
<p>In this website our aim is to explore shark awareness and attitudes as well
  as their behavorial patterns andd sharks in general.
  This website is also designed to display various examples of sharks to ensure that viewers get as much
  information as possible .
  Our hypothesis is that the youth of today are growing up with a negative
  mindset when it comes to this specttacular creatures and they do not value sharks
  role in biodiversity .</p>

  <p>millions of sharks are caught and killed yearly.
    Some kill sharks because they are scared of them or because they do not like them.
    This is foolish as very few of the worlds sharks could ever harm a human.
    In fact thousands more sharks are killed by people than the number of people
    woh are killed by sharks, Thanks to some movies and books, we tend to view
    all sharks as ferocious man-eating creatures.</p>

      As a company supporting shark awareness we find that children are growing up with a negative mindset about
      sharks that may affect the way they too react to them in the future.The facts need to be separated from
      fiction and this website helps viewers understand how important sharks actually are to us.These
      precious animals may soon become extinct if humans continue to act the way they do towards these
      beautiful creatures of the deep blue.</p>
