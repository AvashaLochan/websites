<h1> DIFFERENT TYPES OF SHARKS</h1>
<ol>
  <li>HAMMERHEAD SHARK</li>
  <img src='project images/hammerhead.jpg'>
  <p>
    The hammerhead sharks are a group of sharks in the family Sphyrnidae,
     so named for the unusual and distinctive structure of their heads,
     which are flattened and laterally extended into a "hammer" shape called a cephalofoil.
      Most hammerhead species are placed in the genus Sphyrna,
      while the winghead shark is placed in its own genus, Eusphyra.
      Many, but not necessarily mutually exclusive,
      functions have been proposed for the cephalofoil,
       including sensory reception, manoeuvering, and prey manipulation.
        Hammerheads are found worldwide in warmer waters along coastlines and continental shelves.
        Unlike most sharks, hammerheads usually swim in schools during the day,
        becoming solitary hunters at night.
         Some of these schools can be found near Malpelo Island in Colombia,
          Cocos Island off Costa Rica, and near Molokai in Hawaii.
          Large schools are also seen in the waters off southern and eastern Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
    The known species range from 0.9 to 6.0 m (3.0 to 19.7 ft) in length and weigh
     from 3 to 580 kg (6.6 to 1,278.7 lb).[2][3]
     They are usually light gray and have a greenish tint.
     Their bellies are white which allows them to blend into the ocean when viewed
     from the bottom and sneak up on their prey.[4] Their heads have lateral projections
      which give them a hammer-like shape.</p>

<p>Hammerheads have disproportionately small
 mouths and seem to do a lot of bottom-hunting.
  They are also known to form schools during the day,
   sometimes in groups of over 100. In the evening, like other sharks,
 they become solitary hunters. National Geographic explains that hammerheads
 can be found in warm tropical waters, but during the summer,
  they participate in a mass migration to search for cooler waters.[5]</p>

<h2>Taxonomy and evolution</h2>
<p>Since sharks do not have mineralized bones and rarely fossilize,
 their teeth alone are commonly found as fossils. The hammerheads seem closely related to the carcharhinid
  sharks that evolved during the mid-Tertiary period. According to DNA studies
   the ancestor of the hammerheads probably lived in the Miocene epoch about 20 million years ago.[6]</p>

<p>a phylogenetic tree of the hammerhead sharks showed the winghead shark as its most basal member.
As the winghead shark has proportionately the largest "hammer" of the hammerhead sharks,
 this suggests that the first ancestral hammerhead sharks also had large hammers.[7]
 Fossils show that hammerheads might have evolved earlier during the Paleocene.[8]</P>

<h2>Cephalofoil</h2>
<p>A theory has been advanced that the hammer-like shape of the
 head may have evolved (at least in part) to enhance the animal's vision.[9]
 The positioning of the eyes, mounted on the sides of the shark's distinctive hammer head,
  allows 360° of vision in the vertical plane, meaning the animals can see above and below
   them at all times.[10][11] The shape of the head was previously thought to help the shark find food,
    aiding in close-quarters maneuverability, and allowing sharp turning movement without losing stability. However, the unusual structure of its vertebrae has been found to be instrumental in making the turns correctly, more often than the shape of its head, though it would also shift and provide lift. From what is known about the winghead shark, the shape of the hammerhead apparently has to do with an evolved sensory function. Like all sharks, hammerheads have electroreceptory sensory pores called ampullae of Lorenzini.
     The pores on the shark's head lead to sensory tubes,
     which detect electricity given off by other living creatures.[12]
     By distributing the receptors over a wider area, like a larger radio antenna,
      hammerheads can sweep for prey more effectively.[13]</p>

<h2>Reproduction</h2>
<img src='project images/hammerhead2.jpg'>
<p>Reproduction occurs only once a year for hammerhead sharks, and usually
 occurs with the male shark biting the female shark violently until she agree
 s to mate with him.[14] The hammerhead sharks exhibit a viviparous mode of reproduction
 with females giving birth to live young. Like other sharks, fertilization is internal, with
  the male transferring sperm to the female through one of two intromittent organs called claspers.
   The developing embryos are at first sustained by a yolk sac. When the supply of yolk is exhausted,
   the depleted yolk sac transforms into a structure analogous to a mammalian
   placenta (called a "yolk sac placenta" or "pseudoplacenta"), through which the mother
  delivers sustenance until birth. Once the baby sharks are born,
   they are not take care of by the parents in any way. Usually, a litter
   consists of 12 to 15 pups, except for the great hammerhead, which gives
   birth to litters of 20 to 40 pups. These baby sharks huddle together and
   swim toward warmer water until they are old enough and large enough to survive on their own.[14]</p>

<p>In 2007, the bonnethead shark was found
 to be capable of asexual reproduction via automictic
 parthenogenesis, in which a female's ovum fuses with a polar body to
  form a zygote without the need for a male. This was the first shark known to do this.[15]</p>

<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>Hammerhead sharks are known to eat a large range of prey
 such as fish (including other sharks), squid, octopus, and
 crustaceans. Stingrays are a particular favorite. These sharks
 are often found swimming along the bottom of the ocean, stalking their prey.
  Their unique heads are used as a weapon when hunting down prey.
  The hammerhead shark uses its head to pin down stingrays and eats the ray when
  the ray is weak and in shock.[14] The great hammerhead, tending to be
  larger and more aggressive than most hammerheads, occasionally engages in
  cannibalism, eating other hammerhead sharks, including its own young.[16]
   In addition to the typical animal prey, bonnetheads have been found to feed on seagrass,
    which sometimes makes up as much as half their stomach contents. They may swallow it
    unintentionally, but they are able to partially digest it. This is the only known case of
     a potentially omnivorous species of shark.[17]</p>

    <img src='project images/hammerhead3.jpg'>
    <li>TIGER SHARK</li>
    <img src='project images/tiger1.jpg'>
    <p>The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier[3]) is a species of requiem shark and the only
       extant member of the genus Galeocerdo. It is a large macropredator,
        capable of attaining a length over 5 m (16 ft 5 in).[4] Populations
         are found in many tropical and temperate waters, especially around
          central Pacific islands. Its name derives from the dark stripes down
           its body, which resemble a tiger's pattern but fade as the shark matures.[5]</p>

<p>The tiger shark is a solitary,
  mostly nocturnal hunter. It is notable
   for having the widest food spectrum of
   all sharks, with a range of prey that includes
   crustaceans, fish, seals, birds, squid, turtles,
   sea snakes, dolphins, and even other smaller sharks.
   It also has a reputation as a "garbage eater",[5] consuming
    a variety of inedible, man-made objects that linger in its stomach.
     Though apex predators, tiger sharks are sometimes taken by groups
      of killer whales.[6] It is considered a near threatened species due
       to finning and fishing by humans.[2]</p>


<p>The tiger shark is second
  only to the great white in recorded fatal attacks on humans.[7]</p>
  <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>The shark was first described by Peron
  and Lesueur in 1822, and was given the name Squalus
  cuvier.[4] Müller and Henle in 1837 renamed it Galeocerdo
  tigrinus.[7] The genus, Galeocerdo, is derived from the Greek
   galeos, which means shark, and kerdo, the word for fox.[7] It
    is often colloquially called the man-eater shark.[7]</p>

<p>The tiger shark is a member
   of the order Carcharhiniformes,
   the most species-rich order of sharks,
with more than 270 species also including
 the small catsharks and hammerhead sharks
 .[4] Members of this order are characterized
 by the presence of a nictitating membrane over
  the eyes, two dorsal fins, an anal fin, and five

   gill slits. It is the largest member of the Carcharhinidae family,
    commonly referred to as requiem sharks. This family consists of mostly slender
    but powerful mid- to large-sized sharks and includes some other well-known sharks,
     such as the blue shark (Prionace glauca), lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris)
     , and bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas).</p>
     <h2>Conservation</h2>

The tiger shark is captured and killed for its fins,
 flesh, and liver. It is caught regularly in target
 and nontarget fisheries. Several populations have declined
 where they have been heavily fished. Continued demand for fins
  may result in further declines in the future. They are considered
   a near threatened species due to excessive finning and fishing by
   humans according to International Union for Conservation of Nature.[2]</p>

<p>While shark fin has very few nutrients,
  shark liver has a high concentration of vitamin
   A which is used in the production of vitamin oils.
    In addition, the tiger shark is captured and killed for its distinct skin,
     as well as by big-game fishers.[7]</p>

<p>In 2010, Greenpeace International added the tiger shark to its seafood red list,
   which is a list of fish commonly sold around the world, and which have a very high
    risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.</p>
       <img src='project images/tiger2.jpg'>
       <li>WHALE SHARK</li>
        <img src='project images/whale1.jpg'>
 <img src='project images/whale2.jpg'>
 <p>The whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is a slow-moving,
   filter-feeding carpet shark and the largest known extant
    fish species. The largest confirmed individual had a length
     of 12.65 m (41.5 ft) and a weight of about 21.5 t (47,000 lb).[8]
      The whale shark holds many records for size in the animal kingdom,
       most notably being by far the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate.
       It is the sole member of the genus Rhincodon and the only extant member of
        the family Rhincodontidae which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in
         the class Chondrichthyes. Before 1984 it was classified as Rhiniodon into
         Rhinodontidae. The species originated about 60 million years ago.[9]</p>

<p>The whale shark is found in open waters of the tropical
   oceans and is rarely found in water below 21 °C (70 °F).[2]
    Modeling suggests a lifespan of about 70 years, but measurements
     have proven difficult.[10] Whale sharks have very large mouths and
      are filter feeders, which is a feeding mode that occurs in only two
       other sharks, the megamouth shark and the basking shark. They feed almost
       exclusively on plankton and are not known to pose a threat to humans.
     </p>

<p>The species was distinguished in April 1828 after
  the harpooning of a 4.6 m (15 ft) specimen in Table Bay,
   South Africa. Andrew Smith, a military doctor associated with
    British troops stationed in Cape Town, described it the following
    year.[11] The name "whale shark" refers to the fish's size, being as
     large as some species of whales,[12] and also to its being a filter feeder like baleen whales.</p>

<h2>description</h2>
<p>Whale sharks have a mouth that can be 1.5 m (4.9 ft) wide,
  containing 300 to 350 rows of tiny teeth and 10 filter pads which
   it uses to filter feed.[13] Unlike many other sharks, whale sharks'
    mouths are located at the front of the head rather than on the underside
    of the head.[14] Whale sharks have five large pairs of gills. The head is
    wide and flat with two small eyes at the front. Whale sharks are grey with
    a white belly. Their skin is marked with pale yellow spots and stripes which
     are unique to each individual. The whale shark has three prominent ridges along
      its sides. Its skin can be up to 10 cm (3.9 in) thick. The shark has a pair of
      dorsal fins and pectoral fins. Juveniles' tails have a larger upper fin than lower
       fin, while the adult tail becomes semilunate. The whale shark's spiracles are just
        behind its eyes.</p>
<img src='project images/whale3.jpg'>
<p>The whale shark is the largest non-cetacean
  animal in the world. The average size of adult
   whale sharks is estimated at 9.8 m (32 ft) and
    9 t (20,000 lb).[8] Several specimens over 18 m (59 ft)
     in length have been reported.[15] The largest verified
     specimen was caught on 11 November 1949, near Baba Island,
      in Karachi, Pakistan. It was 12.65 m (41.5 ft) long, weighed
       about 21.5 t (47,000 lb), and had a girth of 7 m (23 ft).[8]
        Stories exist of vastly larger specimens – quoted lengths of
        18 m (59 ft) and 45.5 t (100,000 lb) are common in the popular
         literature, but no scientific records support their existence.
          In 1868, the Irish natural scientist Edward Perceval Wright obtained
          several small whale shark specimens in the Seychelles, but claimed to
           have observed specimens in excess of 15 m (49 ft), and tells of shark
            specimens surpassing 21 m (69 ft).</p>
<img src='project images/whale4.jpg'>
<p>In a 1925 publication, Hugh M. Smith described a
   huge animal caught in a bamboo fish trap in Thailand
   in 1919. The shark was too heavy to pull ashore, but Smith
   estimated the shark was at least 17 m (56 ft) long, and weighed around 37 t.
    These measurements have been exaggerated to 43 t (95,000 lb) and a more precise 17.98
     m (59.0 ft) in recent years. A shark caught in 1994 off Tainan County, southern Taiwan,
      reportedly weighed 35.8 t (79,000 lb).[16] There have even been unverified claims of whale
       sharks of up to 23 metres (75 ft) and 100 tonnes (220,000 lb). In 1934, a ship named the
        Maurguani came across a whale shark in the southern Pacific Ocean, rammed it, and
        the shark became stuck on the prow of the ship, supposedly with 4.6 m (15 ft) on one
        side and 12.2 m (40 ft) on the other.[17] No reliable documentation exists for these
         claims and they remain "fish stories"</p>
         <img src='project images/whale5.jpg'>
<li>GREAT WHITE SHARK</li>
<img src='project images/white1.jpg'>
<p>The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias),
   also known as the great white, white shark or white pointer,
   is a species of large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal
   surface waters of all the major oceans. The great white shark is notable
   for its size, with larger female individuals growing to 6.1 m (20 ft) in
   length and 1,905 kg (4,200 lb) in weight at maturity.[3][4][5] However most
   are smaller, males measuring 3.4 to 4.0 m (11 to 13 ft) and females 4.6 to
    4.9 m (15 to 16 ft) on average.[5][6] According to a 2014 study the lifespan
     of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more, well
     above previous estimates,[7] making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous
     fish currently known.[8] According to the same study, male great white sharks
      take 26 years to reach sexual maturity, while the females take 33 years to be
      ready to produce offspring.[9] Great white sharks can swim at speeds of over
       56 km/h (35 mph),[10] and can swim to depths of 1,200 m (3,900 ft) </p>
<img src='project images/white2.jpg'>
<p>The great white shark has no known natural predators other than,
   on very rare occasions, the killer whale.[12] The great white shark
    is arguably the world's largest known extant macropredatory fish,
    and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals. It is also known
     to prey upon a variety of other marine animals, including fish and seabirds.
      It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon, and is
       ranked first in having the most recorded shark bite incidents on humans.</p>

<p>The species faces numerous ecological challenges
  which has resulted in international protection.
   The IUCN lists the great white shark as a vulnerable species,[2]
    and it is included in Appendix II of CITES.[15] It is also protected
     by several national governments such as Australia (as of 2018).</p>
<img src='project images/white3.jpg'>
<p>The novel Jaws by Peter Benchley and the subsequent
   film by Steven Spielberg depicted the great white shark as
    a "ferocious man eater". Humans are not the preferred prey
     of the great white shark,[17] but, nevertheless, the great white
      is responsible for the largest number of reported and identified fatal
       unprovoked shark attacks on humans.[18] The great white shark has also
       been called the white death.</p>
